Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Format
------

This course is offered through [The MIT/WHOI Joint Program](http://web.mit.edu/mit-whoi/www/). Lectures were held at WHOI and broadcast via private video link to students on the MIT campus. Recitations were on the MIT campus and broadcast via private video link to students at WHOI.

Homework
--------

Homework is worth 30 percent of your grade. There will be 9 problem sets, so each problem set will be worth about 3 percent of your grade. The problem sets will be handed out on Tuesdays and due in class on the following Thursday (so you have a week and a half). We prefer you try to do these problems by yourself, but don't mind if you work in groups.

Mid-term Exam
-------------

There will be a mid-term exam after Ses #12. This exam will cover all of the material covered up to that point. It will be worth 30 percent of your grade.

Final Exam
----------

The final exam will cover all material presented over the semester. It will be a 3-hour, closed book, take home exam and will be worth 30 percent of your grade.

Class Participation
-------------------

This will count for 10 percent of your grade and will be based on attendance and participation in the lectures and recitation.

Lecture Notes and Course Reading
--------------------------------

Electronic copies of the lecture notes will be made available in the [lecture notes]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/lecture-notes) section. For those lectures for which we don't yet have electronic versions of the figures, we will distribute photocopies prior to lecture. There will not be any formal reading assignments for the course, but you may find the following books to be good references:

Pilson, Michael E. Q. _An Introduction to the Chemistry of the Sea_. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1998. ISBN: 9780132589710.

Libes, Susan M. _An Introduction to Marine Biogeochemistry_. New York, NY: Wiley, 1992. ISBN: 9780471509462.

Berner, Elizabeth Kay, and Robert A. Berner. _Global Environment: Water, Air, and Geochemical Cycles_. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1996. ISBN: 9780133011692.
